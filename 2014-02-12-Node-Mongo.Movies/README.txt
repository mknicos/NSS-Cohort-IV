App keeps movies in a database,
shoes all on screen upon page load.

Allows for upadate, adding, and deletion from database.


Future updates: keep movies in browser memory to populate form, not a get request to server,
  Edit button stays on bottom of poster even when info is invisble.
  Change form to appear on screen with a button.
  change delete 'x' to an icon, and put in top border of poster.

Bug: actors array and join methods. Need to make a new Movie constructor when updating.
